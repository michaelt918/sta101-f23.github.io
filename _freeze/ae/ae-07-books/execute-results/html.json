The dataset has 15 observations and 4 columns. Each observation represents a book. Let's take a peek at the data:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nallbacks\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   volume area weight cover\n1     885  382    800    hb\n2    1016  468    950    hb\n3    1125  387   1050    hb\n4     239  371    350    hb\n5     701  371    750    hb\n6     641  367    600    hb\n7    1228  396   1075    hb\n8     412    0    250    pb\n9     953    0    700    pb\n10    929    0    650    pb\n11   1492    0    975    pb\n12    419    0    350    pb\n13   1010    0    950    pb\n14    595    0    425    pb\n15   1034    0    725    pb\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that `volume` is measured in cubic centimeters and `weight` is measured in grams. More information on the dataset can be found in the documentation for `allbacks`, with `?allbacks`.\n\n# Single predictor\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nVisualize the relationship between volume (on the x-axis) and weight (on the y-axis). Overlay the line of best fit. Describe the relationship between these variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n> Add response here.\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nFit a model predicting weight from volume for these books and save it as `weight_fit`. Display a tidy output of the model.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nInterpret the slope and the intercept in context of the data.\n\n> Add response here.\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nCalculate the $R^2$ of this model and interpret it in context of the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n> Add response here.\n\n# Multiple predictors\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nVisualize the relationship between volume (on the x-axis) and weight (on the y-axis), taking into consideration the cover type of the book. Use different colors and shapes for hardback and paperback books. Also use different colors for lines of best fit for the two types of books. In addition, add the overall line of best fit (from Exercise 1) as a gray dashed line so that you can see the difference between the lines when considering and not considering cover type.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nFit a model predicting weight from volume for these books and save it as `weight_cover_fit`. Display a tidy output of the model.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nIn the model output we have a variable `coverpb`. Why is only the `pb` (paperback) level of the `cover` variable shown? What happened to the `hb` (hardback) level?\n\n> Add response here.\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nInterpret the slopes and the intercept in context of the data.\n\n> Add response here.\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nFirst, guess whether the $R^2$ of this model will be greater than, less than, or the same as the previous model, or whether we can't tell. Then, calculate the $R^2$ of this model to confirm your guess, and then interpret it in context of the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n> Add response here.\n\n## Exercise 10\n\nWhich model is preferred for predicting book weights and why?\n\n> Add response here.\n\n## Exercise 11\n\nUsing the model you chose, predict the weight of a hardcover book that is 1000 cubic centimeters (that is, roughly 25 centimeters in length, 20 centimeters in width, and 2 centimeters in height/thickness).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n",
