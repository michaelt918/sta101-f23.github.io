Which of the figures is better for comparing the median annual salaries of hourly and salaried workers.\n\n    a.  @fig-blizzard-1\n    b.  @fig-blizzard-2\n\n2.  In one sentence, explain your reasoning for your answer to Question 1.\n\n    ***A shared x-axis makes it easier to compare summary statistics for the variable on the x-axis.***\n\n3.  The name of the data frame used for this analysis is `blizzard_salary` and the variables plotted are `salary_type` (with values `Hourly` and `Salaried`) and `annual_salary`. Suppose your teammate wrote the following code as part of their analysis of the data.\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    :::\n\n\n    They then printed out the results shown below. Unfortunately one of the number got erased from the printout, it's indicated with `_____` below.\n\n    ```         \n    # A tibble: 2 Ã— 3\n      salary_type mean_annual_salary median_annual_salary\n      <chr>                    <dbl>                <dbl>\n    1 Hourly                  63003.               54246.\n    2 Salaried                90183.               _____\n    ```\n\n    Which of the following is the best estimate for that erased value?\n\n    a.  30,000\n    b.  50,000\n    c.  **80,000 *(It's a value higher than the median for hourly but lower than the mean for salaried)***\n    d.  100,000\n\n4.  Which distribution has a higher standard deviation?\n\n    a.  Hourly workers\n    b.  **Salaried workers *(There is more variability around the mean compared to the hourly distribution)***\n    c.  Roughly the same\n    d.  Can't tell from the information given\n\n5.  \n",
