(Source: [Blizzard Workers Share Salaries in Revolt Over Pay](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-03/blizzard-workers-share-salaries-in-revolt-over-wage-disparities))\n\nThe name of the data frame used for this analysis is `blizzard_salary` and the relevant variables are:\n\n-   `percent_incr`: Raise given in July 2020, as percent increase with values ranging from 1 (1% increase to 21.5 (21.5% increase)\n\n-   `salary_type`: Type of salary, with levels `Hourly` and `Salaried`\n\n-   `annual_salary`: Annual salary, in USD, with values ranging from \\$50,939 to \\$216,856.\n\n-   `performance_rating`: Most recent review performance rating, with levels `Poor`, `Successful`, `High`, and `Top`. The `Poor` level is the lowest rating and the `Top` level is the highest rating.\n\nThe top ten rows of `blizzard_salary` are shown below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 409 × 4\n   percent_incr salary_type annual_salary performance_rating\n          <dbl> <chr>               <dbl> <chr>             \n 1          1   Salaried               1  High              \n 2          1   Salaried               1  Successful        \n 3          1   Salaried               1  High              \n 4          1   Hourly             33987.

The two figures show the same data, with the facets organized across rows and across columns.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of annual salaries of Blizzard employees, Option 1](exam-1-review_files/figure-html/fig-blizzard-hist-1-1.png){#fig-blizzard-hist-1 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of annual salaries of Blizzard employees, Option 2](exam-1-review_files/figure-html/fig-blizzard-hist-2-1.png){#fig-blizzard-hist-2 width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich of the two figures is better for comparing the median annual salaries of hourly and salaried workers.\n\na.  @fig-blizzard-hist-1\nb.  @fig-blizzard-hist-2\n\n## Question 2\n\nSuppose your teammate wrote the following code as part of their analysis of the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThey then printed out the results shown below. Unfortunately one of the number got erased from the printout, it's indicated with `_____` below.\n\n```         \n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  salary_type mean_annual_salary median_annual_salary\n  <chr>                    <dbl>                <dbl>\n1 Hourly                  63003.               54246.\n2 Salaried                90183.               _____\n```\n\nWhich of the following is the best estimate for that erased value?\n\na.  30,000\nb.  50,000\nc.  80,000\nd.  100,000\n\n## Question 4\n\nWhich distribution has a higher standard deviation?\n\na.  Hourly workers\nb.  Salaried workers\nc.  Roughly the same\n\n## Question 5\n\nWhich of the following alternate plots would also be useful for visualizing the distributions of annual salaries of hourly and salaried workers?\n\n```         \nI.  Box plot\nII. Density plot\nIII. Pie chart\nIV. Waffle chart\n```\n\na.  I\nb.  I and II\nc.  I, II, and III\nd.  III and IV\n\n## Question 6\n\nNext, you fit a model for predicting raises (`percent_incr`) from salaries (`annual_salary`). We'll call this model `raise_1_fit`. A tidy output of the model is shown below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term           estimate  std.error statistic   p.value\n  <chr>             <dbl>      <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)   1.87      0.432           4.33 0.0000194\n2 annual_salary 0.0000155 0.00000452      3.43 0.000669 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich of the following is the best interpretation of the slope coefficient?\n\na.  For every additional \\$1,000 of annual salary, the model predicts the raise to be higher, on average, by 1.55%.\nb.  For every additional \\$1,000 of annual salary, the raise goes up by 0.0155%.\nc.  For every additional \\$1,000 of annual salary, the model predicts the raise to be higher, on average, by 0.0155%.\nd.  For every additional \\$1,000 of annual salary, the model predicts the raise to be higher, on average, by 1.87%.\n\n## Question 7\n\nYou then fit a model for predicting raises (`percent_incr`) from salaries (`annual_salary`) and performance ratings (`performance_rating`). We'll call this model `raise_2_fit`. Which of the following is definitely true based on the information you have so far?\n\na.  Intercept of `raise_2_fit` is higher than intercept of `raise_1_fit`.\nb.  RMSE of `raise_2_fit` is higher than RMSE of `raise_1_fit`.\nc.  Adjusted $R^2$ of `raise_2_fit` is higher than adjusted $R^2$ of `raise_1_fit`.\nd.  Slope of $R^2$ of `raise_2_fit` is higher than slope of `raise_1_fit`.\n\n## Question 8\n\nThe tidy model output for the `raise_2_fit` model you fit is shown below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\n  term                            estimate  std.error statistic  p.value\n  <chr>                              <dbl>      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)                   3.55       0.508           6.99 1.99e-11\n2 annual_salary                 0.00000989 0.00000436      2.27 2.42e- 2\n3 performance_ratingPoor       -4.06       1.42           -2.86 4.58e- 3\n4 performance_ratingSuccessful -2.40       0.397          -6.05 4.68e- 9\n5 performance_ratingTop         2.99       0.715           4.18 3.92e- 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhen your teammate sees this model output, they remark \"The coefficient for `performance_ratingSuccessful` is negative, that's weird. I guess it means that people who get successful performance ratings get lower raises.\" How would you respond to your teammate?\n\n## Question 9\n\nUltimately, your teammate decides they don't like the negative slope coefficients in the model output you created (not that there's anything wrong with negative slope coefficients!), does something else, and comes up with the following model output.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\n  term                            estimate  std.error statistic    p.value\n  <chr>                              <dbl>      <dbl>     <dbl>      <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)                  -0.511      1.47          -0.347 0.729     \n2 annual_salary                 0.00000989 0.00000436     2.27  0.0242    \n3 performance_ratingSuccessful  1.66       1.42           1.17  0.242     \n4 performance_ratingHigh        4.06       1.42           2.86  0.00458   \n5 performance_ratingTop         7.05       1.53           4.60  0.00000644\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUnfortunately they didn't write their code in a Quarto document, instead just wrote some code in the Console and then lost track of their work. They remember using the `fct_relevel()` function and doing something like the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nWhat should they put in the blanks to get the same model output as above?\n\na. \"Poor\", \"Successful\", \"High\", \"Top\"\nb. \"Successful\", \"High\", \"Top\"\nc. \"Top\", \"High\", \"Successful\", \"Poor\"\nd. Poor, Successful, High, Top\n\n## Question 10\n\nFinally, create the following two plots and ask you for help deciding which one to use in the final report for visualizing the relationship between performance rating and salary type. In 1-3 sentences, can you help them make a decision, justify your choice, and write the narrative that should go with the plot?\n\n\n::: {#fig-salary-performance-rating .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Option 1](exam-1-review_files/figure-html/fig-salary-performance-rating-1.png){#fig-salary-performance-rating-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Option 2](exam-1-review_files/figure-html/fig-salary-performance-rating-2.png){#fig-salary-performance-rating-2 width=672}\n:::\n\nDistribution of salary type by performance rating\n:::\n",
