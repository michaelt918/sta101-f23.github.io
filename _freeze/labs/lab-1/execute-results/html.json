Go to [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/spaces/405361) and start the project titled **lab-1 - Hello R!**.\n\n2.  Under the *Files* tab on the lower right, click on `lab-1.qmd` to open the lab template.\n\n![](images/open-the-file.png){fig-alt=\"Where to find the file\" width=\"500\"}\n\n3.  Complete the exercises in this document.\n\n## Warm up\n\n### YAML\n\nThe top portion of your Quarto Markdown file (aka `.qmd`), you'll find three dashed lines. Between the dashed lines is called YAML. YAML stands for \"YAML Ain't Markup Language\". It is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.\n\nChange the `author` name to your name and update the `date` with today's date. Click the `render button` to render the document. What do you notice?\n\n::: callout-note\nTo avoid issues that can occur while rendering, it is a good idea to render frequently. **At least after every exercise**.\n:::\n\n### Packages\n\nIn this lab we will work with two packages: the `tidyverse` package which is a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a \"tidy\" way and the `datasauRus` package which contains the data set for today.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(datasauRus)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-warning\nIf you are using `R` on the container, packages we use should already be installed and only need to be **loaded** with the function `library()`. If you are using a local version of `R` you probably have to run the following code in the **console** to install the packages (one time only!)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"datasauRus\")\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Exercises\n\nThe data frame we will be working with today is called `datasaurus_dozen` and it's in the `datasauRus` package. Actually, this single data frame contains 13 data sets (a \"baker's dozen\"), designed to show us why data visualization is important and how summary statistics alone can be misleading. The different data sets are marked by the data set variable.\n\nTo find out more about the data set, type the following in your console (this will bring up the help file).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?datasaurus_dozen\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise 1\n\n::: exercise\nBased on the help file, how many rows and how many columns does the `datasaurus_dozen` file have? What are the **variables** included in the data frame? Add your responses to your lab report under \"Exercise 1\".\n:::\n\nLet's take a look at the names of the data sets inside of `datasaurus_dozen`. To do so this, we can make a frequency table of the \"data set\" variable. Run the code chunk below. Note: when you run the code chunk below, a table \"prints\" to the screen. In general, we say \"print to screen\" to mean that the output of your code should show up on your screen (when asked to 'print to screen' in an assignment, you should make sure the output displays in your rendered document).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndatasaurus_dozen |>\n  count(dataset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 13 × 2\n   dataset        n\n   <chr>      <int>\n 1 away         142\n 2 bullseye     142\n 3 circle       142\n 4 dino         142\n 5 dots         142\n 6 h_lines      142\n 7 high_lines   142\n 8 slant_down   142\n 9 slant_up     142\n10 star         142\n11 v_lines      142\n12 wide_lines   142\n13 x_shape      142\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe original Datasaurus (dino) data was created by Alberto Cairo. The other Dozen were generated using simulated annealing and the process is described in the paper *Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating data sets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics through Simulated Annealing* by Justin Matejka and George Fitzmaurice. In the paper, the authors simulate a variety of data sets that have the same summary statistics as the original Datasaurus but have very different data.\n\n::: callout-note\nYou can view the whole data frame by running the code `view(datasaurus_dozen)` in the console. This will open the data frame in a new tab. Try it out!\n:::\n\n### Exercise 2\n\n::: exercise\nPlot y vs. x for the dino data set. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this data set.\n:::\n\nBelow is the code you will need to complete this exercise. Basically, the answer is already given, but you need to include relevant bits in your `qmd` document and successfully render it and view the results.\n\nStart with the `datasaurus_dozen` and pipe it into the filter function to filter for observations where `dataset == \"dino\"`. Store the resulting filtered data frame as a new data frame called `dino_data`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndino_data <- datasaurus_dozen |>\n  filter(dataset == \"dino\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere is a lot going on here, so let's slow down and unpack it a bit.\n\nFirst, the pipe operator: `|>`, takes what comes before it and sends it as the first argument to what comes after it. So here, we're saying filter the `datasaurus_dozen` data frame for observations where `dataset == \"dino\"`.\n\nSecond, the assignment operator: `<-`, assigns the name `dino_data` to the filtered data frame. Note in `R` you may use either `<-` or `=` for an assignment operator.\n\nNext, we need to visualize these data. We will use the `ggplot` function for this. Its first argument is the data you're visualizing. Next we define the aesthetic mappings. In other words, the columns of the data that get mapped to certain aesthetic features of the plot, e.g. the x axis will represent the variable called x and the y axis will represent the variable called y. Then, we add another layer to this plot where we define which geometric shapes we want to use to represent each observation in the data. In this case we want these to be points, hence `geom_point`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab-1_files/figure-html/ggplot-dino-x-y-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor the second part of this exercise, we need to calculate a summary statistic: the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient (*r*) measures the strength and direction of the linear association between two variables. You will see that some of the pairs of variables we plot do not have a linear relationship between them. This is exactly why we want to visualize first: visualize to assess the form of the relationship, and calculate *r* only if relevant.\n\nIn this case, calculating a correlation coefficient really doesn't make sense since the relationship between x and y is definitely not linear, but is instead more 'dinosaur-esque'.\n\nFor illustrative purposes only, let's calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndino_data |>\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n        r\n    <dbl>\n1 -0.0645\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise 3\n\n::: exercise\nPlot y vs. x for the star dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the *r* of dino?\n:::\n\nTo begin, edit the name of the code chunks from `ex-3-1` and `ex-3-2` to something more meaningful, e.g: `plot-star` and `star-correlation` respectively.\n\n### Exercise 4\n\n::: exercise\nFinally, let's plot all datasets at once. In order to do this we will make use of faceting, given by the code below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, color = dataset)) +\n  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd we can use the `group_by` function to generate all the summary correlation coefficients. We'll see these functions again and again.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndatasaurus_dozen |>\n  group_by(dataset) |>\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y)) \n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### Exercise 5\n\n::: exercise\nDescribe what `|>` does. Hint: run the following two code chunks. What do you notice?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndino_data |>\n  summarize(mu_x = mean(x),\n            mu_y = mean(y))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummarize(dino_data, mu_x = mean(x), mu_y = mean(y))\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### Exercise 6\n\n::: exercise\nIn the above code chunk, identify each of the following as an argument or a function:\n\n-   `summarize`\n\n-   `dino_data`\n\n-   `mean`\n\n-   `x`\n\n-   `y`\n\n-   `mu_x = mean(x)`\n:::\n\n### Exercise 7\n\n::: exercise\nCombine the code from exercises 4 and 5 to compute the `mean(x)` and `mean(y)` for each data set. Print your result to the screen. What do you notice?\n:::\n\n## Formatting\n\nFor all assignments in this course there is a \"formatting\" component to the grade. To receive full points for \"formatting\", you must:\n\n1.  Have your name (and team name if appropriate) at the top of the rendered document\n\n2.  Pipes `|>` and ggplot layers `+` should be followed by a newline (see formatting in code chunks above)\n\n3.  Your code should be under the 80 character code limit. (You shouldn't have to scroll to see all your code on the rendered document).\n\n4.  All exercises and corresponding pages should be linked on Gradescope.\n\nAdding new lines after pipes and layers is a \"tidyverse\" styling. Tidyverse styling is good, general practice and will help make your code more legible.
