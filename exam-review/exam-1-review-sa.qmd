1.  There are 409 rows in the `blizzard_salary` dataset. Each row represents a Blizzard Entertainment worker who filled out the spreadsheet.
2.  a - A shared x-axis makes it easier to compare summary statistics for the variable on the x-axis.
3.  c - It's a value higher than the median for hourly but lower than the mean for salaried.
4.  b - There is more variability around the mean compared to the hourly distribution.
5.  b - Pie charts and waffle charts are for categorical data only.
6.  c - For every additional \$1,000 of annual salary, the model predicts the raise to be higher, on average, by 0.0155%.
7.  d - $R^2$ of `raise_2_fit` is higher than $R^2$ of `raise_1_fit` since `raise_2_fit` has one more predictor and $R^2$ always goes up with the addition of a predictor.
8.  The reference level of `performance_rating` is High, since it's the first level alphabetically. Therefore, the coefficient -2.40% is the predicted difference in raise comparing High to Successful. In this context a negative coefficient makes sense since we would expect those with High performance rating to get higher raises than those with Successful performance.
9.  a - "Poor", "Successful", "High", "Top"
10. Choose Option 2 since it shows the proportions of employees with top, high, successful, and poor performance within each salary type, and is not affected by there being much fewer hourly paid employees.
